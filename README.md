# WhiteHats Selection Task

## 1. Name
M.DHANUSH KOTI

## 2. Why I want to join WhiteHats
I'm excited to join WhiteHats as a first-year student of computer science with a cybersecurity concentration in order to close the knowledge gap between my academic theory and practical application. I want to be surrounded by peers who share my enthusiasm for network defence and ethical hacking. I will be able to support the community and develop the practical skills required to protect digital infrastructure in a setting that is becoming more and more vulnerable by joining this club.
